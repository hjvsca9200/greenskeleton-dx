         <h1>What's happening?</h1>
         <h3>To put it simply, green skeleton is still down for maintnence. Although, not for long.</h3>
         <hr style="width:50%">
         <p>To put it technically, the server where I've had the roms and box artwork hosted is back up and running! (of course, in that time i was unable to find another reliable service)</p>
         <p>green skeleton will still be down for a hot minute because I'd like to take time make the website not look like shit</p>
         <p>In that time, have this gif of Danton hard at work.</p>
         <img src="/imgs/danton.GIF">
         <hr style="width:50%">
         <p>The site will be back up very very soon! So keep your pants and have some patiences until then.</p>
         <p>Thanks for understanding. :]</p>
